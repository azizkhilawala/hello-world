# hello-world
Newbie repository, please don't judge me. I am working on it.

something about me
------------------

Born and brought up in Mumbai, India. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Mumbai. I have gained 1.4 years of professional experience working as a Software Engineer for a multi-national IT consulting company. My motto in life is to acquire as many skills I can that have utility and putting that utility to test.
I love developing websites and applications with a strong emphasis on design and aesthetics. I am passionate towards building products with a focus placed on the quality and enjoyment of the total experience of the end user. I aspire to become a User Experience Designer and Developer.
Filmmaking is an another branch of me which I unhesitatingly indulge in. I enjoy making short films, birthday & promotional videos and dub smashes. When I am not working you can find me video surfing on Youtube, reading health and fitness books and talking about philosophy.
